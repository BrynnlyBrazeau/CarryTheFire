							<h1>Inspiration (Author Biography)</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AbWorks.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6>Cormac McCarthy was an American author born on July 20th of 1933. His novels explore the worst of humanity through
							complex characters that exhibit taboo, morally questionable, and utterly despicable behaviors. McCarthy’s stories fall
							under the post-apocalyptic, gothic, and Western genres.</h6>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AbLocations.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6>McCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island and spent most of his life in Tennessee, Texas, and New Mexico. As such,
							he incorporates regions of the American south and southwest into his works. McCarthy studied liberal arts at the
							University of Tennessee, but never graduated. Instead, he quit school and served in The United States Air Force from
							1953 to 1957.</h6>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AbAdaptations.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6>Cormac McCarthy maintained a reclusive public presence. McCarthy married, and divorced, three times in his life. He had
							two children, about whom little is known. He famously denied public speaking opportunities with the rationale that
							everything he had to say could be found within his books. He avoided TV appearances, though he did codirect multiple TV
							and feature film adaptations of his work.</h6>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AbReligion.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6>His religious views were unclear but continue to be speculated upon due to the philosophical concepts found in his
							works. McCarthy grew up in a Catholic family and has made reference to Christian imagery, though many believe his ideas
							do not align with the religion. His focus on discussing abstract concepts of good and evil has led some fans to label
							him as Gnostic.</h6>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AbTypewriter.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6>It is said that throughout his career, he typed 5 million words on a Olivetti Lettera 32 typewriter that he had
							purchased for $50 ($497.47 as adjusted to 2023 inflation). In 2009, McCarthy put his well-used typewriter up for
							auction. It sold for a whopping $254,500 ($361,460.54 as adjusted to 2023 inflation).</h6>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/AbKing.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h6>Towards the end of his life, Cormac McCarthy became a dedicated member of a theoretical research think tank known as the
							Sante Fe Institute. There, he published an essay titled <i>The Kekulé Problem</i> that examined how language originated. His
							last published work was <i>The Western Family Duology</i>, a pair of novels titled <i>The Passenger</i> and <i>Stella Maris</i>. McCarthy
							passed away on June 13, 2023 at the age of 89.</h6>
